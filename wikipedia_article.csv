Paragraph
"Ingrammar, anarticleis any member of a class of dedicated words that are used withnoun phrasesto mark the identifiability of the referents of the noun phrases. The category of articles constitutes apart of speech."
"InEnglish, both ""the"" and ""a(n)"" are articles, which combine with nouns to form noun phrases. Articles typically specify the grammaticaldefinitenessof the noun phrase, but in many languages, they carry additional grammatical information such asgender,number, andcase. Articles are part of a broader category calleddeterminers, which also includedemonstratives,possessive determiners, andquantifiers. In linguisticinterlinear glossing, articles areabbreviatedasART."
"Adefinite articleis an article that marks adefinite noun phrase. Definite articles, such as the Englishthe,are used to refer to a particular member of a group. It may be something that the speaker has already mentioned, or it may be otherwise something uniquely specified."
"For example, Sentence 1 uses the definite article and thus, expresses a request for a particular book. In contrast, Sentence 2 uses an indefinite article and thus, conveys that the speaker would be satisfied with any book."
The definite article can also be used in English to indicate a specific class among other classes:
"However, recent developments show that definite articles are morphological elements linked to certain noun types due tolexicalization. Under this point of view, definiteness does not play a role in the selection of a definite article more than the lexical entry attached to the article.[clarification needed][1][2]"
"Some languages (such as the continentalNorth Germanic languages,BulgarianorRomanian) have definite articles only assuffixes."
"Anindefinite articleis an article that marks anindefinite noun phrase. Indefinite articles are those such as English ""a"" or ""an"", which do not refer to a specific identifiable entity. Indefinites are commonly used to introduce a new discourse referent which can be referred back to in subsequent discussion:"
Indefinites can also be used to generalize over entities who have some property in common:
Indefinites can also be used to refer to specific entities whose precise identity is unknown or unimportant.
Indefinites also have predicative uses:
"Indefinite noun phrases are widely studied within linguistics, in particular because of their ability to takeexceptional scope."
"Aproperarticle indicates that itsnoun is proper, and refers to a unique entity. It may be the name of a person, the name of a place, the name of a planet, etc. TheMāori languagehas the proper articlea, which is used for personal nouns; so, ""a Pita"" means ""Peter"". In Māori, when the personal nouns have the definite or indefinite article as an important part of it, both articles are present; for example, the phrase ""a Te Rauparaha"", which contains both the proper articleaand the definite articleTerefers to the person nameTe Rauparaha."
"The definite article is sometimes also used with proper names, which are already specified by definition (thereisjust one of them). For example:the Amazon, the Hebrides. In these cases, the definite article may be considered superfluous. Its presence can be accounted for by the assumption that they are shorthand for a longer phrase in which the name is a specifier, i.e.the Amazon River,the Hebridean Islands.[citation needed]Where the nouns in such longer phrases cannot be omitted, the definite article is universally kept:the United States,the People's Republic of China."
"This distinction can sometimes become a political matter: the former usagethe Ukrainestressed the word's Russian meaning of ""borderlands""; asUkrainebecame a fully independent state following thecollapse of the Soviet Union, it requested that formal mentions of its name omit the article. Similar shifts in usage have occurred in the names ofSudanand bothCongo (Brazzaville)andCongo (Kinshasa); a move in the other direction occurred withThe Gambia. In certain languages, such as French and Italian, definite articles are used with all or most names of countries:la France,le Canada,l'Allemagne;l'Italia,la Spagna,il Brasile."
"If a name [has] a definite article, e.g.the Kremlin, it cannot idiomatically be used without it: we cannot sayBoris Yeltsinis in Kremlin."
"Some languages use definite articles withpersonal names, as inPortuguese(a Maria, literally: ""the Maria""),Greek(η Μαρία, ο Γιώργος, ο Δούναβης, η Παρασκευή), andCatalan(la Núria, el/en Oriol). Such usage also occurs colloquially or dialectally inSpanish,German,French,Italianand other languages. InHungarian, the colloquial use of definite articles with personal names, though widespread, is considered to be aGermanism."
"The definite article sometimes appears in American English nicknames such as ""the Donald"", referring to former presidentDonald Trump, and ""the Gipper"", referring to former presidentRonald Reagan.[4]"
"Apartitivearticle is a type of article, sometimes viewed as a type of indefinite article, used with amass nounsuch aswater, to indicate a non-specific quantity of it. Partitive articles are a class ofdeterminer; they are used inFrenchandItalianin addition to definite and indefinite articles. (InFinnishandEstonian, the partitive is indicated by inflection.) The nearest equivalent in English issome, although it is classified as adeterminer, and English uses it less than French usesde."
"Haidahas a partitive article (suffixed-gyaa) referring to ""part of something or... to one or more objects of a given group or category,"" e.g.,tluugyaa uu hal tlaahlaang""he is making a boat (a member of the category of boats).""[5]"
"Anegativearticle specifiesnoneof its noun, and can thus be regarded as neither definite nor indefinite. On the other hand, some consider such a word to be a simpledeterminerrather than an article. In English, this function is fulfilled byno, which can appear before a singular or plural noun:"
"InGerman, the negative article is, among other variations,kein, in opposition to the indefinite articleein."
The equivalent inDutchisgeen:
"Thezero articleis the absence of an article. In languages having a definite article, the lack of an article specifically indicates that the noun is indefinite. Linguists interested inX-bar theorycausally link zero articles to nouns lacking a determiner.[6]In English, the zero article rather than the indefinite is used withpluralsandmass nouns, although the word ""some"" can be used as an indefinite plural article."
"Articles are found in manyIndo-European languages,Semitic languages(only the definite article)[citation needed], andPolynesian languages; however, they are formally absent from many of the world's major languages includingChinese,Japanese,Korean,Mongolian, manyTurkic languages(includingTatar,Bashkir,TuvanandChuvash), manyUralic languages(incl.Finnic[a]andSaami languages),Hindi-Urdu,Punjabi,Tamil, theBaltic languages, the majority ofSlavic languages, theBantu languages(incl.Swahili). In some languages that do have articles, such as someNorth Caucasian languages, the use of articles is optional; however, in others like English and German it is mandatory in all cases."
"Linguists believe the common ancestor of theIndo-European languages,Proto-Indo-European, did not have articles. Most of the languages in this family do not have definite or indefinite articles: there is no article inLatinorSanskrit, nor in some modern Indo-European languages, such as the families ofSlavic languages(except forBulgarianandMacedonian, which are rather distinctive among the Slavic languages in their grammar, and some Northern Russian dialects[7]),Baltic languagesand manyIndo-Aryan languages. AlthoughClassicalGreekhad a definite article (which has survived intoModern Greekand which bears strong functional resemblance to the German definite article, which it is related to), the earlierHomeric Greekused this article largely as a pronoun or demonstrative, whereas the earliest known form of Greek known asMycenaean Greekdid not have any articles. Articles developed independently in several language families."
"Not all languages have both definite and indefinite articles, and some languages have different types of definite and indefinite articles to distinguish finer shades of meaning: for example,FrenchandItalianhave a partitive article used for indefinitemass nouns, whereasColognianhas two distinct sets of definite articles indicating focus and uniqueness, andMacedonianuses definite articles in a demonstrative sense, with a tripartite distinction (proximal, medial, distal) based on distance from the speaker or interlocutor. The wordsthisandthat(and their plurals,theseandthose) can be understood in English as, ultimately, forms of the definite articlethe(whose declension in Old English includedthaes, an ancestral form of this/that and these/those)."
"In many languages, the form of the article may vary according to thegender,number, orcaseof its noun. In some languages the article may be the only indication of the case. Many languages do not use articles at all, and may use other ways of indicating old versus new information, such astopic–commentconstructions."

The following examples show articles which are always suffixed to the noun:
Examples of prefixed definite articles:
"A different way, limited to the definite article, is used byLatvianandLithuanian. 
The noun does not change but the adjective can be defined or undefined. In Latvian:galds, a table / the table;baltsgalds, a white table;baltaisgalds, the white table. In Lithuanian:stalas, a table / the table;baltasstalas, a white table;baltasisstalas, the white table."
"Languages in the above table written initalicsareconstructed languagesand are not natural, that is to say that they have been purposefully invented by an individual (or group of individuals) with some purpose in mind. They do, however, all belong to language families themselves.Esperantois derived from European languages and therefore all of its roots are found inProto-Indo-Europeanand cognates can be found in real-world languages like French, German, Italian and English.Interlinguais also based on European languages but with its main source being that of Italic descendant languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, with German and Russian being secondary sources, with words from further afield (but internationally known and often borrowed) contributing to the language's vocabulary (such as words taken from Japanese, Arabic and Finnish). The result is a supposedly easy-to-learn language for the world. As well as these""auxiliary"" languagesthe list contains two more:QuenyaandSindarin; these two languages were created byProfessor Tolkienand used inhis fictional works. They are not based on any real-world language family (as are Esperanto and Interlingua), but do share a common history with roots inCommon Eldarin."
"When using a definite article inTokelauan language, unlike in some languages like English, if the speaker is speaking of an item, they need not have referred to it previously as long as the item is specific.[8]This is also true when it comes to the reference of a specific person.[8]So, although the definite article used to describe a noun in the Tokelauan language iste, it can also translate to the indefinite article in languages that requires the item being spoken of to have been referenced prior.[8]When translating to English,tecould translate to the English definite articlethe, or it could also translate to the English indefinite articlea.[8]An example of how the definite articletecan be used as an interchangeable definite or indefinite article in the Tokelauan language would be the sentence “Kua hau te tino”.[8]In the English language, this could be translated as “A man has arrived” or “The man has arrived” where usingteas the article in this sentence can represent any man or a particular man.[8]The wordhe, which is the indefinite article in Tokelauan, is used to describe ‘any such item’, and is encountered most often with negatives and interrogatives.[8]An example of the use ofheas an indefinite article is “Vili ake oi k'aumai he toki”, where ‘he toki’ mean ‘an axe’.[8]The use ofheandtein Tokelauan are reserved for when describing a singular noun. However, when describing a plural noun, different articles are used. For plural definite nouns, rather thante, the articlenāis used.[8]‘Vili ake oi k'aumai nā nofoa’ in Tokelauan would translate to “Do run and bring me the chairs” in English.[8]There are some special cases in which instead of usingnā, plural definite nouns have no article before them. The absence of an article is represented by0.[8]One way that it is usually used is if a large amount or a specific class of things are being described.[8]Occasionally, such as if one was describing an entire class of things in a nonspecific fashion, the singular definite nountewould is used.[8]In English, ‘Ko te povi e kai mutia’ means “Cows eat grass”.[8]Because this is a general statement about cows,teis used instead ofnā. Thekoserves as a preposition to the “te” The articleniis used for describing a plural indefinite noun. ‘E i ei ni tuhi?’ translates to “Are there any books?”[8]"
"Articles often develop by specialization ofadjectivesordeterminers. Their development is often a sign of languages becoming moreanalyticinstead ofsynthetic, perhaps combined with the loss ofinflectionas in English, Romance languages, Bulgarian, Macedonian and Torlakian."
"Joseph Greenbergin Universals of Human Language describes ""the cycle of the definite article"": Definite articles (Stage I) evolve from demonstratives, and in turn can become generic articles (Stage II) that may be used in both definite and indefinite contexts, and later merely noun markers (Stage III) that are part of nouns other than proper names and more recent borrowings. Eventually articles may evolve anew from demonstratives.[9]"
"Definite articles typically arise fromdemonstrativesmeaningthat. For example, the definite articles in mostRomance languages—e.g.,el,il,le,la,lo, a, o— derive from theLatindemonstrativesille(masculine),illa(feminine) andillud(neuter)."
"TheEnglishdefinite articlethe, writtenþeinMiddle English, derives from anOld Englishdemonstrative, which, according togender, was writtense(masculine),seo(feminine) (þeandþeoin the Northumbrian dialect), orþæt(neuter). The neuter formþætalso gave rise to the modern demonstrativethat. Theyeoccasionally seen in pseudo-archaic usage such as ""Ye OldeEnglishe Tea Shoppe"" is actually a form ofþe, where the letterthorn(þ) came to be written as ay."
"Multiple demonstratives can give rise to multiple definite articles.Macedonian, for example, in which the articles are suffixed, hasстолот(stolot), the chair;столов(stolov), this chair; andстолон(stolon), that chair. These derive from theProto-Slavicdemonstratives*tъ""this, that"",*ovъ""this here"" and*onъ""that over there, yonder"" respectively.Colognianprepositions articles such as indat Auto, oret Auto, the car; the first being specifically selected, focused, newly introduced, while the latter is not selected, unfocused, already known, general, or generic."
"StandardBasquedistinguishes between proximal and distal definite articles in the plural (dialectally, a proximal singular and an additional medial grade may also be present). The Basque distal form (with infix-a-, etymologically a suffixed and phonetically reduced form of the distal demonstrativehar-/hai-) functions as the default definite article, whereas the proximal form (with infix-o-, derived from the proximal demonstrativehau-/hon-) ismarkedand indicates some kind of (spatial or otherwise) close relationship between the speaker and the referent (e.g., it may imply that the speaker is included in the referent):etxeak(""the houses"") vs.etxeok(""these houses [of ours]""),euskaldunak(""the Basque speakers"") vs.euskaldunok(""we, the Basque speakers"")."
"Speakers ofAssyrian Neo-Aramaic, amodern Aramaic languagethat lacks a definite article, may at times use demonstrativesahaandaya(feminine) orawa(masculine) – which translate to ""this"" and ""that"", respectively – to give the sense of ""the"".[10]InIndonesian, the third personpossessive suffix-nyacould be also used as a definite article.[11]"
"Indefinite articles typically arise from adjectives meaningone. For example, the indefinite articles in theRomance languages—e.g.,un,una,une—derive from theLatinadjectiveunus. Partitive articles, however, derive fromVulgar Latinde illo, meaning(some) of the."
"TheEnglishindefinite articleanis derived from the same root asone. The-ncame to be dropped before consonants, giving rise to the shortened forma. The existence of both forms has led to many cases ofjuncture loss, for example transforming the originala naproninto the modernan apron."
"ThePersianindefinite article isyek, meaning one."
